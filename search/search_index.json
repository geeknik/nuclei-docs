Tip httpx can be used to generate URLs from subdomains as a input for nuclei. Rate Limits \u00b6 Nuclei have multiple rate limit controls for multiple factors including a number of templates to execute in parallel, a number of hosts to be scanned in parallel for each template, and the global number of request / per second you wanted to make/limit using nuclei, here is an example of each flags with description. Flag Description rate-limit Control the total number of request to send per seconds bulk-size Control the number of hosts to process in parallel for each template c Control the number of templates to process in parallel Feel free to play with these flags to tune your nuclei scan speed and accuracy. Tip rate-limit flag takes precedence over other two flag, number of request/seconds can't go beyond the value defined for rate-limit flag regardless the value of c and bulk-size flag. Template Exclusion \u00b6 Since release of nuclei v2.1.1 , Nuclei got support of .nuclei-ignore file that works along with update-templates flag of nuclei, in .nuclei-ignore file, you can define all the template directory or template path that you wanted to exclude from all nuclei scans. Here is the default list of nuclei-ignore file that gets downloaded along with template download/update using update-templates flag and exclude the listed templates and directory from execution. Warning .nuclei-ignore works only when templates are downloaded using update-templates flag. You can always add, update and remove entires from .nuclei-ignore file using any preferred text editor from following location, $HOME/nuclei-templates/.nuclei-ignore Why nuclei-ignore? To ensure nuclei is not getting used to hammer the web servers with templates that are meant to be used for specific use cases, including workflows, templates templates and more, templates that has severe impact, e.g DOS.

The templates will be run on the defined conditions. These are the most efficient way to use nuclei, where all the templates are configured based on needs of users. This means, you can create Technology Based / Target based workflows, like Wordpress Workflow, Jira Workflow which only run when the specific technology is detected. If the tech stack is known, we recommend creating your custom workflows to run your scans. This leads to much lower scan times with better results. Workflows can be defined with workflows attribute, following the template or subtemplates to execute. workflows : - template : technologies/template-to-execute.yaml Type of workflows Generic workflows Conditional workflows Generic Workflows \u00b6 In generic workflow one can define single or multiple template to be executed from a single workflow file. It supports both files and directories as input. A workflow that runs all config related templates on the list of give URLs. workflows : - template : files/git-config.yaml - template : files/svn-config.yaml - template : files/env-file.yaml - template : files/backup-files.yaml A workflow that runs specific list of checks defined for your project. workflows : - template : cves/ - template : exposed-tokens/ - template : exposures/ Conditional Workflows \u00b6 You can also create conditional templates which execute after matching the condition from a previous template.

They are what makes nuclei so powerful, checks are very simple to write and multiple checks can be added as per need for very effective scanning. Types \u00b6 Multiple matchers can be specified in a request. There are basically 6 types of matchers: Matcher Type Part Matched status Integer Comparisons of Part size Content Length of Part word Part for a protocol regex Part for a protocol binary Part for a protocol dsl Part for a protocol To match status codes for responses, you can use the following syntax. matchers : # Match the status codes - type : status # Some status codes we want to match status : - 200 - 302 To match binary for hexadecimal responses, you can use the following syntax. matchers : - type : binary binary : - \"504B0304\" # zip archive - \"526172211A070100\" # rar RAR archive version 5.0 - \"FD377A585A0000\" # xz tar.xz archive condition : or part : body Matchers also support hex encoded data which will be decoded and matched. matchers : - type : word encoding : hex words : - \"50494e47\" condition : or part : body Word and Regex matchers can be further configured depending on the needs of the users. Complex matchers of type dsl allows to build more elaborate expressions with helper functions. These function allow access to Protocol Response which contains variety of data based on each protocol. See protocol specific documentation to learn about different returned results. matchers : - type : dsl dsl : - \"len(body)<1024 && status_code==200\" # Body length less than 1024 and 200 status code - \"contains(toupper(body), md5(cookie))\" # Check if the MD5 sum of cookies is contained in the uppercase body Every part of a Protocol response can be matched with DSL matcher. Some examples - Response Part Description Example content_length Content-Length Header content_length >= 1024 status_code Response Status Code status_code==200 all_headers Unique string containing all headers len(all_headers) body Body as string len(body) header_name Lowercase header name with - converted to _ len(user_agent) raw Headers + Response len(raw) Conditions \u00b6 Multiple words and regexes can be specified in a single matcher and can be configured with different conditions like AND and OR . AND - Using AND conditions allows matching of all the words from the list of words for the matcher. Only then will the request be marked as successful when all the words have been matched. OR - Using OR conditions allows matching of a single word from the list of matcher. The request will be marked as successful when even one of the word is matched for the matcher. Matched Parts \u00b6 Multiple parts of the response can also be matched for the request, default matched part is body if not defined. Example matchers for HTTP response body using the AND condition: matchers : # Match the body word - type : word # Some words we want to match words : - \"[core]\" - \"[config]\" # Both words must be found in the response body condition : and # We want to match request body (default) part : body Similarly, matchers can be written to match anything that you want to find in the response body allowing unlimited creativity and extensibility. Negative Matchers \u00b6 All types of matchers also support negative conditions, mostly useful when you look for a match with an exclusions. This can be used by adding negative: true in the matchers block. Here is an example syntax using negative condition, this will return all the URLs not having PHPSESSID in the response header. matchers : - type : word words : - \"PHPSESSID\" part : header negative : true Multiple Matchers \u00b6 Multiple matchers can be used in a single template to fingerprint multiple conditions with a single request.

As an example, let's say the application sets an object called window.random-object with a value and you want to match on that value. - action : script args : code : window.random-object name : script-name ... matchers : - type : word part : script-name words : - \"some-value\" Nuclei supports running some custom Javascript, before the page load with the hook argument. This will always run the provided Javascript, before any of the pages load. The example provided hooks window.alert so that the alerts that are generated by the application do not stop the crawler. - action : script args : code : (function() { window.alert=function(){} })() hook : true This is one use case, there are many more use cases of function hooking such as DOM XSS Detection and Javascript-Injection based testing techniques. Further examples are provided on examples page. click \u00b6 Click simulates clicking with the Left-Mouse button on an element specified by a selector. action : click args : by : xpath xpath : /html/body/div[1]/div[3]/form/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/div/div[2]/input Nuclei supports a variety of selector types, including but not limited to XPath, Regex, CSS, etc. For more information about selectors, see here . rightclick \u00b6 RightClick simulates clicking with the Right-Mouse button on an element specified by a selector. action : rightclick args : by : xpath xpath : /html/body/div[1]/div[3]/form/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/div/div[2]/input text \u00b6 Text simulates typing something into an input with Keyboard.

Raw and Model based HTTP requests are supported, along with options Non-RFC client requests support too. Payloads can also be specified and raw requests can be transformed based on payload values along with many more capabilities that are shown later on this Page. HTTP Requests start with a request block which specifies the start of the requests for the template. # Start the requests for the template right here requests : Method \u00b6 First thing in the request is method . Request method can be GET , POST , PUT , DELETE , etc depending on the needs. # Method is the method for the request method : GET Redirects \u00b6 Redirection conditions can be specified per each template. By default, redirects are not followed. However, if desired, they can be enabled with redirects: true in request details. 10 redirects are followed at maximum by default which should be good enough for most use cases. More fine grained control can be exercised over number of redirects followed by using max-redirects field. An example of the usage: requests : - method : GET path : - \"{{BaseURL}}/login.php\" redirects : true max-redirects : 3 Path \u00b6 The next part of the requests is the path of the request path. Dynamic variables can be placed in the path to modify its behavior on runtime. Variables start with {{ and end with }} and are case-sensitive. BaseURL - Placing BaseURL as a variable in the path will lead to it being replaced on runtime in the request by the original URL as specified in the target file. Hostname - Hostname variable is replaced by the hostname of the target on runtime. Some sample dynamic variable replacement examples: path : \"{{BaseURL}}/.git/config\" # This path will be replaced on execution with BaseURL # If BaseURL is set to https://abc.com then the # path will get replaced to the following: https://abc.com/.git/config Multiple paths can also be specified in one request which will be requested for the target. Headers \u00b6 Headers can also be specified to be sent along with the requests. Headers are placed in form of key/value pairs. An example header configuration looks like this: # headers contains the headers for the request headers : # Custom user-agent header User-Agent : Some-Random-User-Agent # Custom request origin Origin : https://google.com Body \u00b6 Body specifies a body to be sent along with the request. For instance: # Body is a string sent along with the request body : \"{\\\"some random JSON\\\"}\" # Body is a string sent along with the request body : \"admin=test\" Session \u00b6 To maintain cookie based browser like session between multiple requests, you can simply use cookie-reuse: true in your template, Useful in cases where you want to maintain session between series of request to complete the exploit chain and to perform authenticated scans. # cookie-reuse accepts boolean input and false as default cookie-reuse : true Request Condition \u00b6 Request condition allows to check for condition between multiple requests for writing complex checks and exploits involving multiple HTTP request to complete the exploit chain. with DSL matcher, it can be utilized by adding req-condition: true and numbers as suffix with respective attributes, status_code_1 , status_code_3 , and body_2 for example. req-condition : true matchers : - type : dsl dsl : - \"status_code_1 == 404 && status_code_2 == 200 && contains((body_2), 'secret_string')\" Example HTTP Template \u00b6 The final template file for the .git/config file mentioned above is as follows: id : git-config info : name : Git Config File author : Ice3man severity : medium description : Searches for the pattern /.git/config on passed URLs. requests : - method : GET path : - \"{{BaseURL}}/.git/config\" matchers : - type : word words : - \"[core]\" Raw requests \u00b6 Another way to create request is using raw requests which comes with more flexibility and support of DSL helper functions, like the following ones (as of now it's suggested to leave the Host header as in the example with the variable {{Hostname}} ), All the Matcher, Extractor capabilities can be used with RAW requests in same the way described above. requests : - raw : - | POST /path2/ HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} Content-Length: 1 Origin: https://www.google.com Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9 a=test&b=pd Requests can be fine tuned to perform the exact tasks as desired. Nuclei requests are fully configurable meaning you can configure and define each and every single thing about the requests that will be sent to the target servers. Here follows an example: Intruder payloads \u00b6 It's possible to define placeholders with simple keywords (or using brackets {{helper_function(variable)}} in case mutator functions are needed), and perform Sniper , Pitchfork and ClusterBomb attacks. The wordlist for these attacks needs to be defined during the request definition under the Payload field, with a name matching the keyword, Nuclei supports both file based and in template wordlist support and Finally all DSL functionalities are fully available and supported, and can be used to manipulate the final values. Payloads are defined using variable name and can be referenced in the request between \u00a7 marker, for example \u00a7variable_name\u00a7 . An example of the using payloads with local wordlist: requests : # HTTP Intruder fuzzing using local wordlist. - payloads : parameter : params.txt header : local.txt An example of the using payloads with in template wordlist support: requests : # HTTP Intruder fuzzing using in template wordlist. requests : - payloads : password : - admin - guest - password - test - 12345 - 123456 Note:- be careful while selecting attack type, as unexpected input will break the template. For example, if you used clusterbomb or pitchfork as attack type and defined only one variable in the payload section, template will fail to compile, as clusterbomb or pitchfork expect more then one variable to use in the template. Intruder attack \u00b6 When using intruder, we support multiple attack types, including sniper which generally used to fuzz single parameter, clusterbomb and pitchfork for fuzzing multiple parameters which works same as classical burp intruder on CLI. Types of attack \u00b6 sniper pitchfork clusterbomb Sniper:- The sniper attack uses only one payload set, and it replaces only one position at a time. It loops through the payload set, first replacing only the first marked position with the payload and leaving all other positions to their original value. After its done with the first position, it continues with the second position. Pitchfork:- The pitchfork attack type uses one payload set for each position. It places the first payload in the first position, the second payload in the second position, and so on. It then loops through all payload sets at the same time. The first request uses the first payload from each payload set, the second request uses the second payload from each payload set, and so on. Clusterbomb:- The cluster bomb attack tries all different combinations of payloads. It still puts the first payload in the first position, and the second payload in the second position. But when it loops through the payload sets, it tries all combinations. This attack type is useful for a brute-force attack. Load a list of commonly used usernames in the first payload set, and a list of commonly used passwords in the second payload set. The cluster bomb attack will then try all combinations. You can read more about attack types here . An example of the using using clusterbomb attack to fuzz. # Defining HTTP Intruder attack type attack : clusterbomb # Available attack types: sniper, pitchfork and clusterbomb RAW HTTP Support \u00b6 Nuclei also supports rawhttp for complete request control and customization allowing any kind of malformed requests checks for issues like HTTP request smuggling, Host header injection, CRLF with malformed characters and more. rawhttp library is disabled by default and can be enabled by including unsafe: true in the request block. Here is an example of HTTP request smuggling detection template using rawhttp . requests : - raw : - | POST / HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 150 Transfer-Encoding: chunked 0 GET /post?postId=5 HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: a\"/><script>alert(1)</script> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 5 x=1 - | GET /post?postId=5 HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} unsafe : true # enables rawhttp client matchers : - type : dsl dsl : - 'contains(body, \"<script>alert(1)</script>\")' An example of the using a helper function in the header. raw : # Request with simple header manipulation with DSL functions - | GET /manager/html HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} Authorization: Basic {{base64('username:password')}} User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9 Connection: close Example RAW Template \u00b6 id : http-raw-request info : name : Example-Fuzzing requests : - payloads : username : - admin password : - admin - guest - password - test - 12345 - 123456 attack : clusterbomb # Supported attack types: sniper, pitchfork and clusterbomb raw : # Request with simple header manipulation with DSL functions - | GET /manager/html HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} Authorization: Basic {{base64(username + ':' + password)}} User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9 Connection: close matchers : - type : status status : - 200 Advance Fuzzing \u00b6 We\u2019ve enriched nuclei to allow advanced fuzzing of web servers. Users can now use multiple options to tune HTTP fuzzing workflows. Pipelining \u00b6 HTTP Pipelining support has been added which allows multiple HTTP requests to be sent on the same connection inspired from http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn . Before running HTTP pipelining based templates, make sure the running target supports HTTP Pipeline connection, otherwise nuclei engine fallbacks to standard HTTP request engine. If you want to confirm the given domain or list of subdomains supports HTTP Pipelining, httpx has a flag -pipeline to do so. An example configuring showing pipelining attributes of nuclei. unsafe : true pipeline : true pipeline-max-connections : 40 pipeline-max-workers : 25000 An example template demonstrating pipelining capabilities of nuclei has been provided below- id : pipeline-testing info : name : pipeline testing author : pdteam severity : info requests : - payloads : path : path_wordlist.txt attack : sniper unsafe : true pipeline : true pipeline-max-connections : 40 pipeline-max-workers : 25000 raw : - | GET /\u00a7path\u00a7 HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:79.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/79.0 Accept: application/json, text/plain, */* Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Referer: {{BaseURL}} Connection: keep-alive matchers : - type : status part : header status : - 200 Connection pooling \u00b6 While the earlier versions of nuclei did not do connection pooling, users can now configure templates to either use HTTP connection pooling or not. This allows for faster scanning based on requirement. To enable connection pooling in the template, threads attribute can be defined with respective number of threads you wanted to use in the payloads sections. Connection: Close header can not be used in HTTP connection pooling template, otherwise engine will fail and fallback to standard HTTP requests with pooling. An example template using HTTP connection pooling- id : fuzzing-example info : name : Connection pooling example author : pdteam severity : info requests : - payloads : password : password.txt threads : 40 attack : sniper raw : - | GET /protected HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} Authorization: Basic {{base64('admin:\u00a7password\u00a7')}} User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9 matchers-condition : and matchers : - type : status status : - 200 - type : word words : - \"Unique string\" part : body Smuggling \u00b6 HTTP Smuggling is a class of Web-Attacks recently made popular by Portswigger\u2019s Research into the topic. For an in-depth overview, please visit the article linked above. In the open source space, detecting http smuggling is difficult particularly due to the requests for detection being malformed by nature. Nuclei is able to reliably detect HTTP Smuggling vulnerabilities utilising the rawhttp engine. The most basic example of a HTTP Smuggling vulnerability is CL.TE Smuggling. An example template to detect a CE.TL HTTP Smuggling vulnerability is provided below using the unsafe: true attribute for rawhttp based requests. id : CL.TE-http-smuggling info : name : HTTP request smuggling, basic CL.TE vulnerability author : pdteam severity : info lab : https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/lab-basic-cl-te requests : - raw : - | POST / HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} Connection: keep-alive Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 6 Transfer-Encoding: chunked 0 G - | POST / HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} Connection: keep-alive Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 6 Transfer-Encoding: chunked 0 G unsafe : true matchers : - type : word words : - 'Unrecognized method GPOST' More examples are available in template-examples section for smuggling templates. Race conditions \u00b6 Race Conditions are another class of bugs not easily automated via traditional tooling. Burp Suite introduced a Gate mechanism to Turbo Intruder where all the bytes for all the requests are sent expect the last one at once which is only sent together for all requests synchronizing the send event. We have implemented Gate mechanism in nuclei engine and allow them run via templates which makes the testing for this specfic bug class simple and portable. To enable race condition check within template, race attribute can be set to true and race_count defines the number of simultaneous request you want to initiate. Below is an example template where the same request is repeated for 10 times using the gate logic. id : race-condition-testing info : name : Race condition testing author : pdteam severity : info requests : - raw : - | POST /coupons HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: no-cache, no-transform User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0 promo_code=20OFF race : true race_count : 10 matchers : - type : status part : header status : - 200 You can simply replace the POST request with any suspected vulnerable request and change the race_count as per your need and it's ready to run. nuclei -t race.yaml -target https://api.target.com Multi request race condition testing For the scenario when multiple requests needs to be sent in order to exploit the race condition, we can make use of threads. threads : 5 race : true threads is a total number of request you wanted make with the template to perform race condition testing.

It places the first payload in the first position, the second payload in the second position, and so on. It then loops through all payload sets at the same time. The first request uses the first payload from each payload set, the second request uses the second payload from each payload set, and so on. Clusterbomb:- The cluster bomb attack tries all different combinations of payloads. It still puts the first payload in the first position, and the second payload in the second position. But when it loops through the payload sets, it tries all combinations. This attack type is useful for a brute-force attack.
